The human brain, weighing about 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds), contains approximately 86 billion neurons. Each neuron can connect with thousands of other neurons, forming a complex network responsible for all our thoughts, emotions, and actions. This intricate organ consumes about 20% of the body's oxygen and calories, despite making up only 2% of the body's total weight. Its capacity for learning and adaptation is immense, allowing for continuous development throughout a person's life. Scientists are still unraveling many of its mysteries.
